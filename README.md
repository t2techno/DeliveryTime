# DeliveryTime

A Timer app to help me keep track of information while my wife labored. Originally built in one day between water breaking and contractions beginning. 
Since I now have a newborn, I will be coming back to polish this up later.

## Features

  <li>Contraction info: <ul>
    <li>Number of Contractions</li>
